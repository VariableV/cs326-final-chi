## Innovative Idea
Test It! is a learning tool that gamify's the test writing process for students to encourage them to write good tests. Our intended audience is for teachers to use this to make their classroom learning environment more vibrant and help students creatively compete to learn and design tests that'll help discover bugs and maximize test coverage. 

Teachers assign the desired coverage and Test It! lets the students submit their tests to get points based off how well it fits into the desired coverage. Based on this a leaderboard is created at the end of the assignment's due date, then tests are released for the class to see. The leaderboard data can be used by teachers for any desired classroom reward system such as points in class. This does not relate to any existing applications.

## Important Components
Test It! provides a variety of functionalities. On the end of teacher, they have the ability to create classrooms, invite students via a code, create projects in a given classroom (which includes setting and updating deadlines), add test coverage details for grading the tests, access the leaderboard data as students submit tests, and view submitted tests. For students, they have the ability to create accounts, join classrooms, write and submit tests, see the tests and leaderboard of a project after the deadline has passed, and see their score post-deadline.
